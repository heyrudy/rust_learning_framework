### History of rust-lang

Rust was initially designed and developed by former Mozilla employee [Graydon Hoare](https://github.com/graydon) as a personal project. Mozilla began sponsoring the project in 2009 and announced it in 2010. But the first stable release, Rust 1.0 was released on May 15, 2015.

### Initial goal

The goal of Rust is to be a good programming language for creating highly concurrent, safe and performant systems.

> “Rust is a systems programming language focused on three goals: safety, speed,
> and concurrency.”  
> __ Rust Documentation

Rust is very young and very modern language. It is a **compiled programming language** and
it uses [LLVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM) on the backend. Also, Rust is a **multi-paradigm programming language**, which supports ***imperative***,
***procedural***, ***concurrent actor***, ***object-oriented*** and ***pure functional*** styles.
It also supports ***generic programming*** and ***metaprogramming***, in both *static* and *dynamic* styles.

> 🔎One of Rust’s most unique and compelling features is [Ownership](https://learning-rust.github.io/docs/c1.ownership.html), which is used to achieve memory safety.  
> Rust creates memory pointers optimistically, checks memory pointers’ limited accesses at compile-time  
> with the usage of [References and Borrowing](https://learning-rust.github.io/docs/c2.borrowing.html). And it does automatic compile-time memory management by  
> checking the [Lifetimes](https://learning-rust.github.io/docs/c3.lifetimes.html).
